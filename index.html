        <p>Hey there 👋🏼</p>

        <p>I'm a software engineer based in New York City. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. I enjoy building web applications and solving technical challenges. Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/">Modern Treasury</a>, where I work on our Payments and Compliance products.</p>

        <p>Previously, I was at Facebook working on a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/products/business-apps/">solution</a> for ecommerce platforms integrating with Facebook's family of apps. I worked on both the developer and merchant experiences.</p>
